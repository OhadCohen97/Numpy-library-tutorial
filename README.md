Hello everyone,
I've been working with Numpy for a long time, one of my favorite libraries in Python and I decided to share with you a brief explanation and also upload to GitHub on Jupyter some code snippets that show a little more in depth the power of Numpy.

So for those unfamiliar with the library, what is Numpy?

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
